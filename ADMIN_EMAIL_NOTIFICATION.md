- Action-required alerts
- Clickable customer contact info
- Admin dashboard link

**It's designed to help you process orders quickly!**

## 🚀 How to Enable:

### Step 1: Add Your Admin Email to `.env.local`

```bash
# Your admin/brand email
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

# Or multiple admins (comma-separated)
ADMIN_EMAIL=owner@mynutrinest.in,manager@mynutrinest.in
```

### Step 2: That's It!

Once you add `ADMIN_EMAIL`, you'll automatically receive notifications for every new order!

---

## 📋 When You'll Receive Emails:

### Timeline:
```
1. Customer completes payment
   ↓
2. Webhook processes payment

## 🛠️ Implementation (5 Minutes):

### Step 1: Add Admin Email (1 min)
```bash
# .env.local
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@mynutrinest.in
```

### Step 2: Update Webhook (3 mins)

In `app/api/razorpay/webhook/route.ts`, add this after sending customer confirmation:

```typescript
// Around line 78 (after sending order confirmation email)
await sendOrderConfirmationEmail({
  // ... customer email data
})

// ADD THIS: Send admin notification
try {
  await sendAdminOrderNotification({
    orderNumber: order.id.substring(0, 8).toUpperCase(),
    orderDate: new Date().toISOString(),
    customerName: order.address_json.name,
    customerEmail: order.address_json.email,
    customerPhone: order.address_json.phone,
    items: order.items,
    subtotal: order.subtotal,
    shipping: order.shipping,
    total: order.total,
    paymentId: payment_id, // From webhook event
    address: order.address_json,
  })
  console.log('✅ Admin notification sent')
} catch (error) {
  console.error('⚠️ Admin notification failed (non-critical):', error)
}
```

### Step 3: Import the Function (1 min)

At the top of webhook file:
```typescript
import { 
  sendOrderConfirmationEmail, 
  sendShipmentNotificationEmail,
  sendAdminOrderNotification  // Add this
} from '@/lib/email'
```

---

## 🧪 Testing:

```bash
# 1. Start server
npm run dev

# 2. Place a test order
# Go to http://localhost:3000

# 3. Complete checkout with your email

# 4. Check both inboxes:
# ✉️ Customer email (order confirmation)
# ✉️ YOUR email (admin notification)
```

---

## 📱 Multiple Admin Emails:

Want multiple people to receive notifications?

### Option 1: Comma-Separated (Simple)
```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=owner@mynutrinest.in,manager@mynutrinest.in,warehouse@mynutrinest.in
```

Then update the code to split and send to all:
```typescript
const adminEmails = process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL?.split(',').map(e => e.trim())
await transporter.sendMail({
  from: process.env.SMTP_FROM,
  to: adminEmails, // Array of emails
  subject: `🔔 New Order Received - #${data.orderNumber}`,
  html: generateAdminOrderNotificationHTML(data),
})
```

### Option 2: BCC (Hidden)
```typescript
await transporter.sendMail({
  from: process.env.SMTP_FROM,
  to: 'orders@mynutrinest.in',
  bcc: 'owner@mynutrinest.in,manager@mynutrinest.in', // Hidden copy
  subject: `🔔 New Order Received - #${data.orderNumber}`,
  html: generateAdminOrderNotificationHTML(data),
})
```
