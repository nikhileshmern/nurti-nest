## 📧 Email Configuration (Supabase)

### **Step 1: Configure Email Templates in Supabase**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:** https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to:** Authentication → Email Templates
4. **Find:** "Reset Password" template

### **Step 2: Customize Reset Password Email (Optional)**

You can customize the email template to match your brand:

**Default Template Variables:**
- `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` - The reset link
- `{{ .SiteURL }}` - Your site URL
- `{{ .Token }}` - The reset token

**Example Custom Template:**

```html
<h2>Reset Your Nutri Nest Password</h2>

<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>We received a request to reset your password for your Nutri Nest account.</p>

<p>Click the button below to reset your password:</p>

<a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}" style="display: inline-block; padding: 12px 24px; background-color: #FF6B35; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px;">
  Reset Password
</a>

<p>Or copy and paste this link into your browser:</p>
<p>{{ .ConfirmationURL }}</p>

<p>This link will expire in 1 hour for security reasons.</p>

<p>If you didn't request a password reset, you can safely ignore this email.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br>The Nutri Nest Team</p>
```

### **Step 3: Configure Site URL**

1. In Supabase Dashboard: **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Under **Site URL**, enter your production domain:
   ```
   https://mynutrinest.in
   ```

   ```
   https://mynutrinest.in/reset-password
   http://localhost:3000/reset-password  (for local testing)
   ```
