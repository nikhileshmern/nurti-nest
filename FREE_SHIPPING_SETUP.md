```

```sql
-- In database
SELECT subtotal, shipping, total FROM orders;
-- shipping should be 0 for all new orders
```

### **Issue: Shiprocket shipment not created**

Shiprocket shipment creation happens AFTER payment in webhook.

3. ✅ Pickup location set?

**Shipping charges and shipment creation are separate!**
