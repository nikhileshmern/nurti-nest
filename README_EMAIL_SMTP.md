# ✅ SMTP Email Service - Ready to Use!

## What I Just Did for You

I've updated your email service to use **SMTP** instead of Resend. This is **better** because:

✅ More flexible (use any email provider)
✅ No vendor lock-in
✅ Can use your existing hosting email
✅ Same beautiful email templates
✅ Professional sender address (orders@mynutrinest.in)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Package (30 seconds)
```bash
npm install nodemailer @types/nodemailer
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Email Provider

Pick the easiest option for you:

#### 🟢 **OPTION A: Gmail** (Easiest for Testing)

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Create app password for "Mail"
3. Copy the 16-character password
4. Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=yourname@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
SMTP_FROM="Nutri Nest <yourname@gmail.com>"
```

**Time**: 2 minutes | **Cost**: FREE | **Limit**: 500 emails/day

---

#### 🔵 **OPTION B: Your Domain Email** (Best for Production)

1. Login to your hosting (cPanel, etc.)
2. Find email settings or create `orders@mynutrinest.in`
3. Get SMTP settings (usually `mail.yourdomain.com`)
4. Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=mail.mynutrinest.in
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=orders@mynutrinest.in
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-email-password
SMTP_FROM="Nutri Nest <orders@mynutrinest.in>"
```

**Time**: 3 minutes | **Cost**: FREE (included with hosting) | **Limit**: Usually unlimited

### Step 3: Test It!
```bash
npm run dev
# Place a test order
# Check your email inbox
# Look for: "Order Confirmation"
```
